**End-to-End Business Intelligence & Customer Analytics Project**

## Executive Summary
**This project delivers a comprehensive data-driven analysis of e-commerce sales performance and customer behavior to uncover revenue drivers, profitability patterns, and customer segmentation insights.**

**Using advanced SQL analysis, Python-based data processing, and customer analytics techniques (including RFM segmentation), this project transforms raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.**

***The objective is to support strategic decisions related to:***

Revenue optimization

Customer retention

Product performance

Marketing effectiveness

Profitability improvement

## Business Objectives
The analysis addresses key business questions:

Which products and categories drive the highest revenue and profit?

Who are the most valuable customers?

What are the purchasing patterns over time?

How can we identify churn risk customers?

Which customer segments generate sustainable growth?

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes structured e-commerce transactional records such as:

Order ID

Customer ID

Order Date

Product Category

Sales Revenue

Quantity

Discount

Profit

Region

The dataset contains both transaction-level data and customer-level behavioral data enabling multi-dimensional analysis.

## Analytical Approach
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handling missing values

Data type corrections

Date feature extraction (Month, Year, Quarter)

Profit margin calculation

Removing duplicate records

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
***Performed in-depth analysis to identify patterns:***

Revenue trends over time

Monthly & quarterly growth

Category-wise sales distribution

Region-wise performance

Profit vs Discount relationship

### Sales Performance Analysis
Top-selling products

High-margin categories

Revenue contribution by region

Seasonal demand patterns

Customer purchase frequency

### Customer Insight Analysis (RFM Segmentation)
Calculated:

Recency – Days since last purchase

Frequency – Total number of transactions

Monetary – Total spending

Customers were segmented into:

High-Value Customers

Loyal Customers

Potential Loyalists

At-Risk Customers

Churned Customers

This enables targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Insights
A small percentage of customers contribute a majority of revenue (Pareto Principle).

High discounts negatively impact overall profit margins.

Certain regions consistently outperform others in revenue growth.

Repeat customers generate significantly higher lifetime value.

Churn-risk customers show declining frequency patterns before inactivity.
